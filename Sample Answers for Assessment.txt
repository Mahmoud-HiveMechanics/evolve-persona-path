Self-Awareness: Recall a time when you received feedback that initially stung but later proved valuable. How did you process it?
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“During a board meeting, one of our investors told me I tend to shut down debate when my ideas are challenged. Honestly, it irritated me — I felt they didn’t appreciate how much pressure I’m under to deliver results. I dismissed it at first, assuming they just didn’t see the bigger picture. Later, when another colleague said something similar, I was surprised, but I still didn’t dwell on it. I guess I prefer to move forward rather than overanalyze how I come across.”
Summary:
This CEO reacts defensively, with little emotional reflection or curiosity about how their leadership style affects others. Feedback is acknowledged superficially but not integrated. Their focus remains on control and outcomes rather than awareness — Emerging.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“I once received feedback from my executive team that I sometimes dominate discussions and don’t give others enough space to contribute. It stung, because I saw myself as a decisive leader driving clarity. Initially, I felt misunderstood — I thought strong leadership required strong presence. A few days later, I realized they might be right. I’ve started pausing more before responding and asking for others’ input, though I still catch myself reverting under pressure.”
Summary:
Here, the CEO acknowledges emotions and reflects after the fact, showing willingness to grow but inconsistent self-regulation. Feedback is processed rationally, but emotional integration and behavioral consistency are still developing — Developing.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“After a major presentation, one of my senior leaders told me that my communication can feel intimidating to the team. My first reaction was defensive — I’ve always valued candor and efficiency. But I took time to think about it and realized my tone could make others hesitant to challenge me. I began asking my team to give me real-time feedback and experimented with softer phrasing and open-ended questions. It’s made our strategic discussions more balanced and creative.”
Summary:
This CEO demonstrates genuine reflection and behavioral adaptation, connecting intent to impact. They use feedback as data for growth and begin integrating awareness into daily leadership behavior — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“After a leadership retreat, my CHRO shared that I often move too quickly from problem to solution, which can leave people feeling unheard. It stung because I pride myself on being efficient and action-oriented. But as I reflected, I saw the truth in it — my need for speed sometimes overshadows the emotional processing others need. Since then, I’ve made it a practice to slow down, name the tension in the room, and invite more perspectives before deciding. It’s deepened trust and improved decision quality across the organization.”
Summary:
This CEO shows mature emotional intelligence — recognizing blind spots, linking them to values, and adjusting behavior to create systemic improvement. Reflection is intentional and growth-oriented — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“Several years ago, my coach told me that my constant drive to protect the organization and my people sometimes prevents others from developing their own resilience. It was uncomfortable to hear because care and accountability are core to who I am. But that feedback became transformative. I realized that by stepping in too quickly, I was unintentionally limiting others’ leadership growth. I began practicing deeper listening and asking generative questions instead of providing answers. Over time, that shift created a leadership culture rooted in trust, empowerment, and shared ownership.”
Summary:
This CEO embodies deep self-awareness and humility. They process feedback through reflection and values alignment, translating insight into cultural transformation. Awareness becomes part of who they are — Thriving.


Self-Responsibility: Describe a time when you had to take full ownership of a failure. How did you respond?
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“As CEO, there was a time when one of our product launches didn’t go as planned. The marketing team missed key deadlines and the execution fell short. I was frustrated because I felt they hadn’t followed my direction properly. I addressed the issue with them and reminded everyone of the importance of accountability. In my view, the team needed to perform better — it wasn’t really my failure, as I had given clear guidance.”
Summary:
This response reflects avoidance of personal accountability and a focus on blaming others. The CEO positions themselves as separate from the outcome, showing little reflection on their role in the failure. Responsibility is seen as enforcement, not ownership — consistent with Emerging.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“A major client renewal fell through, and although I was disappointed in the sales team’s performance, I later realized I hadn’t provided enough oversight or clarity. Initially, I blamed external factors — the market, the client’s budget — but eventually, I acknowledged I could have been more proactive. I apologized to the board and implemented stricter review processes. It was uncomfortable, but it taught me that even as CEO, I can’t assume things will ‘just happen’ without alignment.”
Summary:
This CEO demonstrates growing recognition of shared responsibility, but the focus remains on procedural correction rather than deeper self-examination. Accountability comes after reflection, not instinctively — Developing.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“Early in my tenure as CEO, we missed a major growth target. I initially felt pressure to explain it in external terms, but I realized that our lack of focus came from decisions I made. I took full responsibility with the board and the team — not to take the blame, but to learn openly. I held a town hall to discuss what we missed and what I’d do differently. It helped me model that accountability is not about guilt; it’s about growth and transparency.”
Summary:
This CEO shows clear ownership and emotional maturity. They model accountability publicly, link responsibility to learning, and create psychological safety for others to follow suit. Reflection is honest and constructive — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“We once made an acquisition that didn’t deliver the value we expected. I had championed the deal, so when it underperformed, I took full responsibility. Instead of assigning blame, I led an open post-mortem with the board and leadership team to understand what we had overlooked. I communicated candidly with employees and investors, acknowledging the misstep and the lessons learned. That transparency actually deepened trust. I learned that credibility isn’t built by avoiding mistakes — it’s built by owning them with integrity.”
Summary:
Here, the CEO demonstrates mature, transparent leadership. Accountability is proactive, public, and used to strengthen trust and learning across the organization. This mindset exemplifies Flourishing — responsible, values-driven leadership.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“A few years ago, we invested heavily in a transformation that didn’t align with our deeper purpose. I realized too late that I’d been driven by ambition more than by wisdom. When it became clear that the initiative was unsustainable, I gathered the company and openly took responsibility — not just for the decision, but for the mindset that led to it. I shared what I learned about humility, discernment, and the courage to course-correct. We turned that experience into a reflection framework that’s now part of our culture. For me, ownership is no longer about taking blame — it’s about leading with honesty, humanity, and renewal.”
Summary:
This CEO shows integrated accountability rooted in conscience and self-awareness. They link failure to collective learning and cultural transformation. Ownership becomes regenerative — transforming error into wisdom and trust — characteristic of Thriving leadership.
Continuous Personal Growth: Tell me about a time you stepped outside your comfort zone to grow as a leader.
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“As CEO, I don’t really see a need to step outside my comfort zone deliberately as this happens anyway all the time. I’ve built the company on what I know works, and that’s what I try to stick to. I get approached about leadership development programs or executive coaching, but honestly, I think those are more for people who have too much time on their hands or haven’t figured out their leadership style yet. I’ve been doing this long enough to know my strengths — I focus on what I do best.”
Summary:
Shows complacency and rigidity. The leader equates experience with growth and dismisses learning opportunities. Comfort and control are prioritized over evolution — Emerging self-concept.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“The board once suggested I work with an external advisor to improve how I communicate with investors. I wasn’t thrilled about it — I felt I already had a clear message. But I went along because it seemed expected. It was uncomfortable at first, and while I did learn a few things, I didn’t make big changes afterward. Growth still feels like something I respond to rather than initiate.”
Summary:
Growth is reactive and compliance-driven. The CEO acknowledges value but doesn’t yet internalize learning. Discomfort is endured, not embraced — Developing awareness.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“I agreed to take on a cross-industry advisory role with a company outside our sector. It was unfamiliar territory, and I felt out of my depth at first. But the experience taught me to listen more, question assumptions, and adapt faster. I brought those lessons back to our executive team, especially around how we make strategic decisions. That discomfort pushed me to see leadership less as certainty and more as curiosity.”
Summary:
Demonstrates proactive growth through challenge. The CEO reframes discomfort as learning and connects personal development to organizational benefit — solidly Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“I deliberately sought a coach who would challenge not just my strategy thinking but my emotional patterns as a leader. It was humbling — I had to face how my drive for excellence sometimes created pressure for others. That insight helped me evolve from being the visionary ‘driver’ to being a more empowering leader. I’ve since encouraged my executive team to do the same kind of inner work, because organizational growth always mirrors personal growth.”
Summary:
Shows emotional maturity and integrated reflection. The CEO embraces vulnerability, connects growth to leadership culture, and models development publicly — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“I intentionally stepped away from the company for a few months to join a leadership immersion in a developing economy — I wanted to understand systems of resilience outside our corporate context. It completely reshaped my perspective on power, privilege, and service. When I returned, we redesigned parts of our business strategy to reflect a more sustainable and inclusive worldview. Growth, to me, now means continuously expanding our consciousness as leaders, not just our competence.”
Summary:
Reflects transformational, purpose-aligned growth. The CEO uses discomfort and learning to evolve personally, culturally, and systemically. Growth is continual, conscious, and service-oriented — Thriving.
Trust & Psychological Safety: Describe a time when you took a risk to be vulnerable with your team. What was the outcome?
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“I don’t really believe it’s helpful for a CEO to show vulnerability. My team looks to me for confidence and direction. If I start sharing doubts or personal struggles, it could undermine their trust. There was one board meeting where I almost admitted I was uncertain about our strategy, but I stopped myself — leaders need to project strength.”
Summary:
Shows fear of vulnerability and a control mindset. Trust is seen as dependent on authority rather than authenticity — Emerging leadership.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“There was a time when we missed a quarterly target, and I told my executive team I was frustrated and overwhelmed. They appreciated the honesty, but afterward, I felt exposed. I worried I’d lost some authority. I think it’s okay to be open sometimes, but it has to be carefully managed so people don’t see weakness.”
Summary:
Reflects conditional openness. Vulnerability is selectively used and emotionally unsafe for the leader. Trust is tentative — Developing.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“During a strategic reset, I admitted to my leadership team that I didn’t have all the answers. I asked for their candid input, even if it challenged my view. That moment changed the tone of our meetings — people spoke up more freely, and our solutions got sharper. I learned that showing uncertainty doesn’t reduce trust — it builds it, because people feel included in the process.”
Summary:
Displays practical vulnerability and growing trust orientation. The CEO connects openness to collaboration and innovation — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“When a major initiative failed, I addressed the entire company and took responsibility for the misjudgment. I shared not just what went wrong, but how it felt to miss the mark and what I’d learned. It was one of the most vulnerable moments of my career, but it strengthened our culture profoundly — people began speaking more honestly in meetings, and blame decreased. I realized that trust grows in transparency.”
Summary:
Shows mature, grounded vulnerability. The CEO models authenticity as a catalyst for learning and psychological safety — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“In an executive retreat, I shared something deeply personal — that after years of success, I sometimes questioned my worth beyond results. It sparked a profound conversation among the team about identity and purpose. That openness became the foundation for a new level of trust and connection across leadership. Since then, we’ve built regular reflection circles where vulnerability is normalized. It’s now part of how we lead together.”
Summary:
Exemplifies transformational authenticity and cultural modeling. Vulnerability is used intentionally to elevate connection, resilience, and humanity in leadership. The CEO embodies Thriving psychological safety.


Empathy & Awareness of Others: Tell me about leading someone who was struggling emotionally or professionally. How did you approach it?
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“One of my team members seemed distracted lately, missing deadlines and not performing well. I told them to get it together because we all have problems, but work still needs to get done. I didn’t ask what was going on — I figured if something was wrong, they’d tell me. My job is to focus on results, not people’s personal issues.”
Summary:
This reflects low empathy and self-centered focus. The person dismisses emotional context, prioritizes performance over people, and assumes others should self-manage without support. There’s little awareness of emotional impact or relational nuance — clearly Emerging behavior.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“I had a team member who seemed down and was making more mistakes than usual. I asked if they were okay, but when they said they were ‘fine,’ I just told them to focus on their tasks. Later, I realized they were going through something personal. I felt bad, but I didn’t know what else to say or do. I think people should handle their emotions outside of work.”
Summary:
Here, the person recognizes emotion but lacks depth or skill to respond empathetically. They notice cues and express surface concern but remain uncomfortable engaging further. They value professionalism over connection — consistent with the Developing stage.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“One of my colleagues was struggling to meet expectations after a tough period at home. I asked to chat privately and gave them space to share if they wanted to. I tried to listen without interrupting and offered flexible deadlines where possible. I didn’t always know the right words to say, but I wanted them to feel supported. Later, they told me that conversation helped them refocus. It reminded me that empathy doesn’t mean solving — sometimes it’s just listening.”
Summary:
This answer demonstrates growing emotional awareness and compassionate intention. The person actively listens, adjusts expectations, and reflects afterward to learn. There’s recognition of others’ perspectives and emotional needs — hallmark traits of the Expanding level.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“I noticed one of my team members had become withdrawn and quieter in meetings. I reached out to them for a check-in, expressing genuine concern rather than focusing on performance. They opened up about feeling overwhelmed and doubting their abilities. I validated their feelings, reminded them of their strengths, and adjusted priorities to lighten their load temporarily. Over the next weeks, we had regular touchpoints, and I saw their confidence return. That experience deepened our trust and improved team morale.”
Summary:
This reflects high emotional intelligence, empathy in action, and balanced support. The leader reads emotional cues, responds compassionately, and adjusts context to meet the person’s needs. They create psychological safety and genuine connection — fully Flourishing empathy.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“When a senior team member began withdrawing and underperforming, I sensed it wasn’t just workload — the energy in our conversations had shifted. I invited them for a walk outside the office and shared that I’d noticed a change, asking how they were really doing. They eventually opened up about burnout and personal loss. I listened deeply, encouraged them to take space for recovery, and restructured responsibilities to support their healing. I also brought the topic of emotional well-being to the wider leadership team to normalize these discussions. Supporting them authentically strengthened not only our relationship but our culture as a whole.”
Summary:
This response shows integrated empathy, systemic awareness, and leadership through connection. The person instinctively senses emotional shifts, responds with deep presence and care, and extends compassion beyond the individual — cultivating collective emotional intelligence. This represents the Thriving level of empathy and awareness of others.
Empowered & Shared Responsibility: Describe a time when you successfully empowered a team member to take ownership.
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“One of my executives seemed distracted and missed a few key deadlines. I told them to focus on performance because the business doesn’t stop for personal issues. If there’s a problem, it’s up to them to bring it up — my job is to keep the company on track.”
Summary:
Shows low empathy, task-oriented focus, and self-centered leadership. The CEO ignores emotional context and assumes employees should self-manage challenges — Emerging behavior.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“I noticed a director seemed disengaged and asked if they were okay. They said they were fine, so I didn’t push further and just reminded them of priorities. Later I realized they were struggling personally. I felt bad about not noticing sooner, but I wasn’t sure how to respond appropriately, so I mostly left it alone.”
Summary:
Displays awareness without skillful engagement. The CEO notices emotional cues but defaults to professional boundaries, leaving limited support — typical Developing empathy.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“One of my VPs was underperforming after a family crisis. I invited them for a private conversation, listened carefully without judgment, and offered flexibility where possible. I didn’t have all the answers, but my goal was to create a space where they could feel heard. Later, they told me that conversation helped them refocus and regain confidence.”
Summary:
Shows active listening, compassion, and reflective learning. The CEO adjusts expectations and recognizes emotional needs, connecting empathy to performance support — Expanding level.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“I noticed a senior leader withdrawing in meetings and seemed stressed. I reached out for a genuine check-in, focusing on understanding their experience rather than their output. We discussed their challenges, I validated their feelings, and we jointly adjusted priorities to reduce pressure temporarily. Regular follow-ups helped restore their confidence and strengthened trust, ultimately improving team morale.”
Summary:
Demonstrates high emotional intelligence in action. The CEO balances empathy with organizational needs, uses emotional insight to drive engagement, and fosters psychological safety — Flourishing empathy.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“When a key executive’s energy and engagement dropped, I noticed a shift in their tone and interactions. I invited them for a reflective walk outside the office, shared my observations, and asked how they were really doing. They disclosed burnout and personal loss. I listened deeply, supported time for recovery, and reallocated responsibilities. Beyond that, I used the experience to start a broader dialogue on well-being at the leadership level, normalizing open conversations about emotional health. The result strengthened both individual trust and our organizational culture.”
Summary:
Shows integrated empathy, systemic awareness, and cultural leadership. The CEO senses emotional undercurrents, responds with deep care, and elevates collective awareness — Thriving leadership behavior.


 Purpose, Vision & Aligned Outcome: Describe aligning your team around a shared purpose. What impact did it have?
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“When I’m given a project, I focus on completing my part. As long as I deliver what’s expected on time, I consider it a success. I don’t usually get involved in discussions about the overall purpose or goals — that’s more for senior leaders. My main concern is doing my job well and moving to the next task.”
Summary:
This response shows transactional focus and lack of connection to purpose. The leader views their role as executing instructions, not contributing to direction or alignment. No engagement with “why” — clearly Emerging.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“I know that understanding the bigger picture helps, so I try to connect our work to the company goals when they’re communicated to me. Sometimes I’ll share those goals with my team during project kick-offs, but I mostly stick to task planning. I rely on senior leadership to set the direction, and I focus on ensuring we deliver on what’s expected.”
Summary:
This shows awareness without ownership. The person recognizes that purpose and vision matter but doesn’t actively drive alignment. Their engagement is reactive and dependent on others — a Developing mindset.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“During a product redesign, I realized the team was busy completing tasks but unclear about why the changes mattered. I organized a session to discuss the customer need behind the project and how success would be measured. Once everyone saw the bigger picture, the energy shifted — people started making smarter design decisions on their own. That experience taught me that alignment drives both motivation and quality.”
Summary:
This response reflects emerging outcome-based leadership. The person facilitates clarity and connection to purpose, proactively aligning team actions with broader goals. Purpose becomes a guiding tool, not just a slogan — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“I led a cross-functional team to define our annual priorities. Instead of setting goals top-down, I facilitated workshops where we co-created our shared purpose and key outcomes. We mapped each role to the impact we wanted to achieve. Once alignment was clear, collaboration improved dramatically, and teams began solving problems together rather than in silos. The sense of ownership and trust grew across the group.”
Summary:
Here, the leader co-creates and sustains alignment through purpose-driven facilitation. They use purpose as a coordination mechanism and motivational tool, demonstrating consistent clarity and communication — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“In my current role, I see purpose as the foundation of everything we do. When we restructured our department, I brought the team together to define our ‘north star’ — how our work contributes to the organization’s mission and to society. We built a shared vision statement and designed our metrics, rituals, and decision-making structures around it. The result has been a highly autonomous, values-driven team that stays aligned even through major change.”
Summary:
This reflects purpose-driven systems leadership — the leader sustains purpose at scale, aligning strategy, culture, and structure. Purpose isn’t a concept; it’s embedded in how people think, act, and decide. This is fully Thriving.
Culture of Leadership: Tell me about shifting from directing a team to empowering them to lead themselves.


1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“When I first became a team lead, I focused mainly on making sure everyone hit their targets. My role was to give instructions, track performance, and correct mistakes quickly. I didn’t think much about personal growth or team culture — I see my job as keeping people productive. When issues come up between team members, I expect them to sort it out themselves.”
Summary:
This leader is task-oriented and directive, with minimal focus on developing people or emotional awareness. Growth and culture are not seen as leadership responsibilities — Emerging.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“I’ve realized leadership isn’t just about managing work, but I still find it challenging to focus on people’s development. I try to support my team when they ask for help, but I’m not always proactive. I give performance feedback and encourage skill-building, though I avoid deeper conversations about emotions or mindset. I know trust and openness matter, but I’m not sure how to create that consistently.”
Summary:
Here the leader acknowledges the importance of personal and relational growth but lacks confidence or consistency in supporting it. They’re reactive rather than intentional — Developing.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“When I noticed some tension between two team members, I facilitated a conversation instead of stepping in with a solution. I asked questions to help them understand each other’s perspectives and encouraged them to take responsibility for resolving it. Since then, I’ve started using one-on-one meetings to reflect with my team about what they’re learning, not just what they’re delivering. I’m realizing that when people lead themselves, my job becomes easier and more meaningful.”
Summary:
This shows growing coaching capability and self-awareness. The leader is experimenting with empowerment, reflection, and emotional support — moving from directing to enabling — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“A few years ago, I consciously shifted from being the problem-solver to being a coach. I began building a team culture where everyone is responsible for their own learning and each other’s success. We hold monthly reflection sessions to share lessons and challenges openly. I model vulnerability and encourage the team to take risks and learn from failure. As a result, they’ve become more confident in leading projects independently, and collaboration has deepened significantly.”
Summary:
This leader embeds growth and empowerment into team culture. They demonstrate psychological safety, emotional intelligence, and coaching behaviors that develop others’ leadership capacity — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“In my current organization, my focus has been building a culture where everyone sees themselves as a leader — regardless of role. We’ve embedded reflection, peer coaching, and shared decision-making into our daily work. My role now is to hold the vision and ensure systems support continuous learning and relational trust. I see leadership as something we grow through each other, not something I hold. Our culture has become self-sustaining, with people mentoring and empowering each other across levels.”
Summary:
This response represents systemic empowerment and cultural leadership. The leader enables others to lead, designs environments for shared growth, and models purpose-driven, relational leadership — fully Thriving.


Harnessing Tensions: Describe a conflict that initially seemed problematic but led to a breakthrough.


1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“When conflict arises, I usually let management handle it. I prefer to focus on my own work and stay out of disagreements. There was one situation where two team members disagreed about how to complete a task, and I just followed the instructions I was given once the manager decided. I don’t like confrontation — it only slows things down.”
Summary:
This leader avoids tension entirely, relies on hierarchy for resolution, and sees disagreement as a disruption to productivity rather than an opportunity for growth — Emerging.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“I once had a disagreement with a colleague about how to handle a client request. I tried to keep the peace and didn’t really address it directly, but the tension built up over time. Eventually, our manager helped mediate the discussion. After that, I realized it would’ve been better to talk about the issue earlier, though I still find it uncomfortable to bring up conflict myself.”
Summary:
Here the person is beginning to recognize the value of addressing conflict but still avoids it until it becomes unavoidable. They rely on others to mediate and lack confidence in constructive dialogue — Developing.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“I used to avoid disagreements, but I’m learning they can lead to better outcomes. Recently, our team clashed over priorities for a new project. Instead of staying silent, I facilitated a meeting where everyone shared their viewpoints. It was tense at first, but hearing different perspectives helped us find a stronger solution that combined everyone’s ideas. It taught me that conflict can actually move things forward if handled with respect.”
Summary:
This leader actively engages in conflict resolution, experimenting with open discussion and feedback. They are learning to see tension as productive and beginning to integrate collaboration into decision-making — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“Our team had a serious disagreement about the direction of a product feature. I encouraged everyone to share their reasoning openly and made sure every voice was heard, even when opinions clashed. The conversation was challenging, but it surfaced insights we hadn’t considered. By the end, the team aligned around a better, user-focused design. It reinforced my belief that tension, handled well, strengthens both relationships and results.”
Summary:
Here, the leader creates psychological safety for conflict, uses empathy and structure to facilitate dialogue, and leverages diverse perspectives for innovation. They see tension as a growth mechanism — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“In our organization, we treat tension as a source of innovation. When two teams clashed over priorities during a major transformation, I brought everyone together to explore the underlying needs behind their positions. Instead of resolving the conflict myself, I helped them co-design a process for making future trade-offs collaboratively. It led to a lasting shift — now, healthy debate and open feedback are part of our culture, and teams handle conflict autonomously with maturity and trust.”
Summary:
This leader models systemic conflict transformation — turning tensions into opportunities for learning, innovation, and structural improvement. They’ve embedded collaborative decision-making and open dialogue into the organization’s DNA — Thriving.
Positive Impact on Stakeholders: Tell me about balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders in a strategic decision.
1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“When making strategic decisions, I primarily focus on what will improve our internal performance metrics and ensure we meet quarterly targets. For example, when we faced a budget shortfall, I reduced supplier contracts and paused customer support investments to protect our internal financial goals. My priority was keeping the team efficient and delivering on internal KPIs.”
Summary:
This leader is internally focused, prioritizing operational efficiency and short-term internal goals. They view stakeholders as external to the business rather than part of its ecosystem — Emerging.
________________


2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“In a recent product launch, there were conflicting demands between our investors wanting speed and our customers asking for more testing. I decided to move forward with the launch to meet revenue expectations. Looking back, I realize customer trust suffered, and we spent more time on fixes later. I try to meet stakeholder expectations when they’re critical, but it’s often hard to balance without slowing things down.”
Summary:
The CEO acknowledges stakeholder importance but tends to prioritize internal or investor needs. Stakeholder engagement is reactive, with limited foresight or integration — Developing.
________________


3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“Last year, we needed to restructure a business unit, which affected employees, suppliers, and customers. Instead of making the decision in isolation, I held sessions with key partners and sought employee feedback. While it slowed things down, their input helped us design a transition that minimized disruption. It taught me that stakeholder dialogue leads to better, more sustainable outcomes—even if it feels complex at first.”
Summary:
This leader sees stakeholders as active contributors to organizational success. They begin to seek mutual understanding and long-term value, though processes may still be ad hoc — Expanding.
________________


4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“When we developed our sustainability strategy, there were tensions between short-term profit goals and long-term environmental commitments. We invited customers, investors, and community representatives into the conversation. Through dialogue, we co-created targets that balanced profitability with responsibility. This approach built trust and created stronger alignment across our ecosystem. It reinforced my belief that value grows when we grow together.”
Summary:
This CEO co-creates strategy with stakeholders, embedding mutual value creation into decision-making. They balance commercial, human, and societal outcomes, building a culture of transparency and shared purpose — Flourishing.
________________


5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“We view our company as part of a living ecosystem — our success depends on the health of our customers, partners, communities, and environment. During our recent global expansion, we faced trade-offs between cost efficiency and local community well-being. We chose to invest in local supplier networks and education programs, even though it extended our payback period. That decision deepened trust, inspired innovation, and strengthened our brand as a force for good.

Embracing Change & Innovation: Describe leading through significant change and handling resistance.


1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“When major changes come up, I try to minimize disruption. Stability is what keeps the business running. A few years ago, the board wanted to overhaul our internal systems, but I insisted we keep the old processes—they’ve always worked. Change just creates confusion and slows people down. My focus is to maintain control and make sure everyone sticks to the plan.”
Summary:
This leader resists change, prioritizing control, stability, and familiar systems. Innovation is viewed as risky or unnecessary, and adaptability is minimal — Emerging.

2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“When the company shifted to remote operations, I followed the new policy but found it frustrating. I missed our old routines and struggled with all the new tools. I waited for clear direction from IT before making adjustments. Once things settled, I did my best to keep people focused, though I mostly relied on the old ways of working where possible.”
Summary:
This CEO acknowledges change but adapts reluctantly. They participate in transformation only when required and avoid taking ownership of innovation or improvement — Developing.

3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“During our digital transformation, I initially worried about how the team would handle so much change. But I realized I needed to model openness. I started asking for feedback, testing new systems myself, and admitting what I didn’t know. Some people resisted, so I communicated why we were changing and listened to their concerns. It wasn’t smooth, but we came out stronger and more capable.”
Summary:
This leader is learning to embrace change with curiosity and self-awareness. They see discomfort as part of progress and actively engage others in adapting — Expanding.

4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“When we decided to shift our entire business model toward subscription services, it meant rethinking our sales approach, operations, and culture. Resistance was natural—I expected it. I spent time helping people connect the change to our purpose, co-designing solutions with cross-functional teams. That engagement turned hesitation into ownership. Within a year, the same people who resisted became champions of the new model.”
Summary:
This CEO leads change with purpose and collaboration, creating structures that encourage innovation and shared ownership. They transform resistance into energy for growth — Flourishing.

5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“I see change not as disruption but as the rhythm of leadership. When our market shifted dramatically, we didn’t react defensively—we leaned into the uncertainty. I invited the entire leadership circle to explore what the world was asking of us, not just what we wanted to preserve. Some felt uneasy, but through deep dialogue we reimagined our identity and strategy. That openness sparked new products, partnerships, and a culture of continuous reinvention. Change, to me, is how we stay alive and purposeful.”
Summary:
This leader embodies adaptability and creative emergence. They use uncertainty as fuel for renewal, aligning innovation with human and systemic needs. They model calm, courage, and co-creation — Thriving.
Social & Ethical Stewardship: Tell me about a decision where ethical considerations conflicted with business pressures.


1. Emerging (1–20)
Response:
“When facing tough decisions, my job is to protect the bottom line. Once, a supplier was accused of poor labor practices, but they offered the best price. Since it wasn’t illegal, I decided to continue working with them. Ethics are important, but ultimately, we’re here to make money and stay competitive.”
Summary:
This leader views ethics as secondary to business success. Decisions are made purely on financial or operational grounds, with no consideration for social or environmental impact — Emerging.

2. Developing (20–40)
Response:
“When we were asked to cut costs, I knew one option involved outsourcing to a partner with less transparent environmental standards. I didn’t feel great about it, but it met our compliance requirements and wasn’t against the law. I told myself it wasn’t my place to challenge it—it was just business.”
Summary:
This CEO shows basic compliance and awareness, but lacks the courage or systems to act beyond rules. Ethical issues are acknowledged but treated as secondary priorities — Developing.

3. Expanding (40–60)
Response:
“A few years ago, a client offered a large contract that required us to relax our data privacy standards. It would’ve boosted revenue significantly, but it didn’t align with our values around transparency and user trust. I brought the issue to the leadership team, and we decided to walk away. That decision cost us in the short term, but it built enormous trust with our customers and employees.”
Summary:
This leader acts according to personal and organizational values, even at financial cost. They are learning that ethical integrity strengthens trust and long-term value — Expanding.

4. Flourishing (60–80)
Response:
“When we realized one of our product lines had unintended environmental consequences, we made the decision to suspend its rollout and redesign it, even though it delayed a key quarter’s revenue. I led open conversations with our stakeholders, admitted our mistake publicly, and involved partners in finding sustainable alternatives. That transparency deepened our relationships and turned an ethical challenge into an innovation opportunity.”
Summary:
This CEO leads with conscience and accountability, integrating ethics into business strategy. They treat ethical challenges as opportunities for regeneration and trust-building — Flourishing.

5. Thriving (80+)
Response:
“We were approached by investors seeking rapid returns, but their model would have required cutting our sustainability commitments and workforce wellbeing initiatives. I made the decision to decline the investment. I explained that our company exists to create shared prosperity—for people, planet, and profit. Instead, we attracted impact-aligned investors who shared our long-term view. For me, ethics isn’t a trade-off; it’s the reason we lead.”
Summary:
This leader embodies stewardship and systemic ethics. Decisions are guided by a moral compass rooted in interdependence and long-term wellbeing. They model business as a regenerative, values-driven force for good — Thriving.
