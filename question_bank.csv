S1.0,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration","You've just presented a new strategic initiative to the board/main investors. The chairman interrupts you mid-presentation with pointed criticism about your approach, questioning several of your core assumptions in front of everyone. You notice your heart rate increasing and a sense of defensiveness rising. How do you respond?",S1.0.A,"Engage directly with the critique while maintaining focus: ""I appreciate you raising these concerns - they touch on critical assumptions. Let me address each point specifically and share the additional context that informed our thinking. This might help clarify how we arrived at these recommendations.""",S1.0.A.1,
S1.0,,,S1.0.B,"Pause to acknowledge both the critique and the moment: ""That's an important challenge to our thinking. I notice I'm having a strong reaction to it, which tells me there's something valuable here. Can you elaborate on your concerns so I can better understand them?""",S1.0.B.1,
S1.0,,,S1.0.C,"Broaden the conversation to include other perspectives: ""Thank you for raising these points. Before I respond, I'd like to hear if others share similar concerns or have different perspectives on the assumptions we've made.""",S1.0.C.1,
S1.0,,,S1.0.D,"Recognize the tension as potentially productive: ""This disagreement highlights an important tension in our strategy. Rather than resolving it immediately, perhaps we should explore both perspectives more deeply as they might reveal something neither of us sees yet.""",S1.0.D.1,
S1.0.A.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration","The chairman listens to your additional data but remains unconvinced, saying: ""You're not addressing my fundamental concerns."" Other board members are shifting uncomfortably in their seats. You've done extensive research and genuinely believe your proposal is the right path forward.",S1.0.A.1.1,"Address underlying concerns while maintaining conviction: ""Your perspective is valuable and I want to understand it better. Our team has explored multiple scenarios, and this approach emerged as optimal based on our market analysis and capabilities. Perhaps we could identify specifically which assumptions concern you most so we can examine them together.""",,
S1.0.A.1,,,S1.0.A.1.2,"Suggest a structured review process: ""Your concerns deserve serious consideration. I propose we establish a small working group with representatives from the board and executive team to review our assumptions over the next two weeks.""",,
S1.0.A.1,,,S1.0.A.1.3,"Acknowledge the impasse and adapt: ""It's clear we have different perspectives on this. Rather than pushing forward, let's take a step back. I'll work with my team to develop alternative approaches that might address your concerns.""",,
S1.0.A.1,,,S1.0.A.1.4,"Call for a temporary pause: ""I sense we're at an impasse that might benefit from reflection. Perhaps we should take a short break and return to this discussion with fresh perspectives, or continue this at our next meeting after we've all had time to consider the different viewpoints.""",,
S1.0.B.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others","As you explore the chairman's concerns, you realize they stem from information you weren't aware of - a recent conversation with a key client that contradicts some of your assumptions. This new context significantly changes the situation. The chairman suggests postponing the decision while emphasizing the urgency of addressing these concerns. After the meeting, you gather your team to share this development. The team has mixed reactions - some are frustrated at the delay and challenge to their work, while others are already generating new approaches. Several senior team members appear reluctant to substantially revise the strategy given the tight timeline and resources already committed.",S1.0.B.1.1,Let's approach this methodically. I want to understand exactly how this client feedback changes our assumptions. I'll work directly with our research and strategy teams to reanalyze our data and create an amended proposal that preserves our core direction while addressing these new insights.,,
S1.0.B.1,,,S1.0.B.1.2,This situation impacts us differently across the team. Let's first have an open discussion about both the strategic implications and our reactions to this shift before we determine our path forward. I want to hear all perspectives before we decide how to revise our approach.,,
S1.0.B.1,,,S1.0.B.1.3,I sense this new information has created uncertainty for the team. Let's begin by acknowledging everyone's contributions and the disappointment some might feel. I want to create a safe environment for us to express concerns and rebuild confidence as we adapt our approach. Supporting each other through this adjustment is as important as the strategic revision itself.,S1.0.B.1.3.1,
S1.0.B.1,,,S1.0.B.1.4,"I believe we'll develop the strongest response by distributing this challenge. I'd like three working groups to independently develop alternative approaches by tomorrow - one focused on minimal adjustments, one on moderate revision, and one on reimagining our strategy - then we'll evaluate and integrate the best elements.",,
S1.0.B.1.3.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others","Your approach of creating a safe space for the team resonates well. After acknowledging the emotional impact and allowing space for concerns, the team develops a revised strategy that was well-received by the board. However, your analysis of the information gathering process has revealed a more significant issue: there are structural disconnects between your product development, sales, and customer success teams that create ongoing blind spots. Key leaders from each department have different priorities and are resistant to changing their established processes. Some argue the recent situation was an anomaly that doesn't justify a major operational change, while others see it as symptomatic of deeper issues.",S1.0.B.1.3.1.1,"Let's approach this systematically. I propose we map our current information flows to identify specific breakdown points, then implement targeted improvements to address them. I'll work directly with each team to ensure changes integrate with their existing priorities.",,
S1.0.B.1.3.1,,,S1.0.B.1.3.1.2,"I see this as an opportunity to build stronger cross-team relationships. I'll establish quarterly cross-functional strategy sessions where customer insights are shared directly between teams, supplemented by a new shared digital dashboard for ongoing visibility.",,
S1.0.B.1.3.1,,,S1.0.B.1.3.1.3,"Rather than imposing a solution, I believe we need to create shared ownership of this challenge. I'll facilitate a series of workshops where teams can collectively diagnose the issues and design new connection points, with my role being to ensure accountability for the outcomes.",,
S1.0.B.1.3.1,,,S1.0.B.1.3.1.4,"This situation reflects natural tensions between specialization and integration. Instead of focusing solely on processes, I want to explore how we might evolve our organizational structure to better balance team autonomy with cross-functional collaboration.",,
S1.0.C.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others","As you open the floor to other board members, different perspectives emerge. Some share the chairman's concerns while others support your approach. The discussion reveals that board members have different priorities and risk tolerances regarding the initiative. The chairman appreciates the broader discussion but states that the board needs to reach consensus before approving such a significant strategic shift.",S1.0.C.1.1,"(Focusing on Purpose, Vision & Aligned Outcome) ""I'd like to refocus our discussion on our strategic objectives and market position. The different perspectives we've heard give us valuable inputs, but we need to ensure any changes remain aligned with our core vision. I'll revise our approach to address key concerns while preserving our strategic direction.""",S1.0.C.1.1.1,
S1.0.C.1,,,S1.0.C.1.2,"(Focusing on Empathy & Awareness of Others) ""What I'm hearing reflects genuinely different perspectives based on each person's unique experiences and responsibilities. Before moving forward, I want to meet individually with each of you to truly understand your concerns and viewpoints, which will help me integrate these insights thoughtfully.""",S1.0.C.1.2.1,
S1.0.C.1,,,S1.0.C.1.3,"(Focusing on Harnessing Tensions for Effective Collaboration) ""These differing viewpoints aren't obstacles - they're valuable tensions that can strengthen our approach. Rather than choosing one perspective over another, let's identify the valid concerns on each side and design a strategy that consciously balances these competing values.""",,
S1.0.C.1,,,S1.0.C.1.4,"(Focusing on Culture of Leadership) ""This conversation demonstrates how important it is that we all share in shaping our strategic direction. I suggest forming a small advisory team with representatives of these different perspectives to co-create the revised approach, which I'll facilitate but not dictate.""",,
S1.0.C.1.1.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others, Purpose, Vision & Aligned Outcome","Your focus on aligning underlying values and principles rather than specific tactics resonates with the board. Over the next two weeks, you facilitate a series of discussions that lead to a clearer articulation of the company's risk tolerance and innovation philosophy. This clarity helps resolve the initial disagreement, but it also surfaces inconsistencies in how these principles have been applied across different business units, creating internal friction and market confusion.",S1.0.C.1.1.1.1,"Now that we have clarity at the board level, I'll personally work with each business unit leader to ensure they understand and implement these principles consistently. I'll develop a clear framework for them to follow in decision-making.",,
S1.0.C.1.1.1,,,S1.0.C.1.1.1.2,Let's use this moment to involve our broader leadership team. I'll organize a leadership summit where business unit heads can work together to interpret these principles for their contexts and identify areas where alignment is most critical.,,
S1.0.C.1.1.1,,,S1.0.C.1.1.1.3,"This inconsistency presents both a challenge and an opportunity. I suggest we create a cross-functional team to examine how our newly clarified principles should influence our product roadmap, go-to-market strategy, and resource allocation across all business units.",,
S1.0.C.1.1.1,,,S1.0.C.1.1.1.4,The inconsistencies we're seeing likely reflect different market realities across our business units. I propose we develop a meta-framework that allows for principled flexibility – clear shared values with explicit parameters for how they may be adapted to different contexts.,,
S1.0.C.1.2.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others","Your focus on understanding individual board member perspectives proves valuable. The one-on-one conversations reveal important insights into their concerns and priorities. However, the process takes time, and meanwhile, the market continues to evolve. A key competitor has just announced a major initiative in an area related to your proposal. This news creates additional pressure and urgency around your strategic decision.",S1.0.C.1.2.1.1,"This competitive move validates parts of our strategy while challenging others. I'll accelerate our revision process, leveraging the insights from our individual discussions to create a more refined proposal that addresses the board's diverse concerns while responding to this market development.",,
S1.0.C.1.2.1,,,S1.0.C.1.2.1.2,"The competitor's move changes our context but shouldn't rush our decision-making. I'll organize an emergency board session to share what I've learned from our individual conversations along with this new market information, so we can collectively determine how to respond.",,
S1.0.C.1.2.1,,,S1.0.C.1.2.1.3,"This development presents an opportunity to test our insights in a real market context. I'll propose a limited, agile implementation of our strategy that allows us to gather market feedback quickly while continuing our internal alignment process.",,
S1.0.C.1.2.1,,,S1.0.C.1.2.1.4,"The competitive announcement creates an interesting tension between thorough alignment and timely action. I'll share a synthesis of our one-on-one discussions with the entire board, highlighting how different perspectives might view this market development, and facilitate a discussion about our appropriate response timeline.",,
S1.0.D.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others","Your suggestion to explore the tension between perspectives shifts the dynamic of the meeting. The chairman acknowledges the value of this approach, and a rich discussion follows that uncovers some underlying assumptions on both sides. However, it also reveals a fundamental difference in how board members view the company's competitive positioning and risk profile. The meeting concludes with agreement to continue exploring both perspectives, but without clear resolution on your strategic initiative.",S1.0.D.1.1,"(Focusing on Continuous Personal Growth) ""This discussion has challenged my own thinking about our strategy. I'll use this as an opportunity to reflect on my assumptions and blind spots, then revise our approach with a more expansive perspective. I'll share both my personal reflections and the updated strategy at our next meeting.""",,
S1.0.D.1,,,S1.0.D.1.2,"(Focusing on Embracing Change & Driving Innovation) ""The tension we've uncovered is exactly what drives innovative thinking. I'd like to completely reframe how we're approaching this opportunity by bringing in external perspectives and unorthodox thinking. Let's use this disagreement to spark truly creative options we haven't yet considered.""",S1.0.D.1.2.1,
S1.0.D.1,,,S1.0.D.1.3,"(Focusing on Trust & Psychological Safety) ""The honest exchange we've had today is valuable but I sense some underlying concerns may not have been fully expressed. I'd like to create a safer space for candid dialogue by meeting with you individually, then facilitating a more structured conversation where all perspectives can be heard.""",,
S1.0.D.1,,,S1.0.D.1.4,"(Focusing on Social and Ethical Stewardship) ""These different risk perspectives reflect broader questions about our responsibility to various stakeholders. I suggest we evaluate our strategy not just on financial metrics, but on its long-term impact on our customers, employees, and communities before making our final decision.""",,
S1.0.D.1.2.1,"Self-Awareness, Trust & Psychological Safety, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration, Empathy & Awareness of Others, Embracing Change & Driving Innovation","Your suggestion to organize a dedicated session on market positioning proves valuable. With expert input and structured discussion, the board develops a more nuanced understanding of competitive dynamics. However, this deeper analysis reveals that your organization has been inconsistent in how it measures and defines success, making it difficult to evaluate strategic options objectively. These inconsistencies have created internal confusion and potentially missed opportunities.",S1.0.D.1.2.1.1,"I'll take ownership of developing a standardized success measurement framework. After consulting with key stakeholders, I'll implement consistent metrics across the organization that align with our strategic objectives.",,
S1.0.D.1.2.1,,,S1.0.D.1.2.1.2,"This measurement challenge reflects different functional perspectives on value creation. I'll convene a working group with representatives from finance, operations, sales, and product to develop an integrated measurement approach that respects these different dimensions.",,
S1.0.D.1.2.1,,,S1.0.D.1.2.1.3,"Before jumping to a solution, I think we need to understand the root causes of these inconsistencies. I'll initiate a discovery process to explore how different parts of the organization have developed their approaches and what we can learn from each.",,

S2.0,"Self-Awareness, Empathy & Awareness of Others, Harnessing Tensions for Collaboration","As the CEO of a rapidly growing technology firm, you're facing a complex conflict between your Chief Product Officer (CPO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Both are highly competent and respected leaders who joined the company around the same time three years ago. The dispute centers around the development roadmap for your flagship product. The CPO advocates for prioritizing new customer-facing features to expand market share, while the CTO wants to spend six months fixing the underlying code problems that are making the system increasingly unstable and unreliable. Both have made compelling cases to you privately, citing data and strategic reasoning. However, their disagreement has begun affecting their respective teams, creating tension in leadership meetings, and potentially slowing the company's momentum. Recently, you've overheard concerns from other executives about ""taking sides"" and worries about how this conflict might impact upcoming investor discussions. How would you approach this situation?",S2.0.A,"Bring both leaders together to facilitate a direct dialogue.
